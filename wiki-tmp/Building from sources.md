# Building from sources

If you want to use/try COJAC, you don't have to download the sources and 
rebuild - just download the cojac.jar file. 
But you certainly have your reasons. Or maybe you would like to modify or extend COJAC, e.g. with a new number type; then don't hesitate to contact us and share your ideas. 

Anyway, the project is using Java 8 and Apache Maven. 
Here are the steps to build COJAC: 

- clone the Git repository from `https://github.com/Cojac/Cojac.git`

- go to the folder and run the Maven command: `mvn package`

  It compiles, runs the tests, and produces the target/cojac.jar file.
