--------------------------------------------------
= 1. Installation =

Our Cojac Eclipse Plugin is to be installed from Eclipse: Help -> Install New Software... -> Work with... -> http://frederic.bapst.home.hefr.ch/cojac/eclipse/update/

Then follow the wizard (accept the licence, re-start Eclipse).

--------------------------------------------------
= 2. User Guide =

 * The plugin offers a new "Run Configuration Type" as a replacement for the existing "Java Application". You access it with the contextual menu shortcut (Right click -> Run As -> Java Application under Cojac), or the Run Configurations... dialog. 

 * Running a Java application in this mode invokes Cojac and warning messages are produced in the console. The messages are automatically parsed and the corresponding markers are created; those markers appear in the edit window, and in the Problems view.
 
 * You can adjust the options for Cojac in the corresponding panel of the Run Configuration dialog.
 
 * The markers can be removed from the Problems view.

--------------------------------------------------
= 3. Limitations =

 * We only support Java Applications. Nothing for the moment for Applets, JUnit Test Cases and so on... Note that recent COJAC releases use javaagent technology, and activating the analysis is just a matter of adding a JVM option. So COJAC is easy to use in any IDE (but without the "problem markers" feature).
 
 * Removing the markers is a bit annoying: you have to act in the Problems view, and select the right warnings by hand.
