Issues for enriched numbers (option -R)

- Verbose mode & interface: interfaces risk to be loaded by the verifier class
and to don't get instrumented.

- Array reference through proxy: The proxy breaks the references with float &
  double arrays. A fix has been done but it does not cover all cases. A test 
  shows the problem in ch.eiafr.cojac.unit.replace. The name of the test:
  arrayPassedInNotInstrumentedSideModifiedWithAnOtherMethod

- Native methods: The native methods can be called but they cannot call methods 
  or access to instance or class fields.

- Java reflection: not handled at all...

- Callback: The callback written by the user will be instrumented and will not
  work in uninstrumented part if it uses the float or double types.
  Test example: arraySortedWithUserDefinedComparator
  
  UPDATE (17.08.15, BAP): Java2Demo works pretty well, but there is at least
  one instance of this "callback" issue: somehow a 
  java2d.demos.Fonts.AttributedStr$ScalableImageGraphicAttribute, which extends 
  the uninstrumented abstract class java.awt.font.GraphicAttribute, is created
  and given to swing, which finally tries to call 'float getAdvance()'; this
  will be not found, and we get an AbstractMethodError.
  That particular problem happens to have a workaround: add a bypass to Cojac: 
  with: -b java2d.demos.Fonts.AttributedStr$ScalableImageGraphicAttribute

As is, Cojac is built with jdk6.21, then works well with jvm6 or jvm7.
It compiles with jdk7, but some of the tests fail ("missing frame").

Updating ASM to 4.0 doesn't directly help, but will be done soon anyway.

Using COMPUTE_FRAMES instead of COMPUTE_MAXS solves the build/test issue, 
but the result causes sometimes LinkageError at runtime with jvm7. It is
strange, as with the -javaagent mode, the SystemClassLoader is the only 
classloader at runtime (ok, except the bootclassloader). So it seems that
somehow, instrumenting a class C causes another "load class C" event, and that
such "reentrant" class loadings don't get instrumented, and we get 2 versions
of the same class. Just a hypothesis (hinted by 
http://osdir.com/ml/java.objectweb.asm/2007-07/msg00007.html).

I suspect the original problem of failing tests under jdk7 built to have its
root in the various "inserted methods" (log, print...), which asmified bytecode
have been gathered quite a long time ago (jvm5 code?). This should be updated.
